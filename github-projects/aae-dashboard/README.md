# AAE Dashboard - Knowledge Lake Control Center

A full-stack web application serving as the unified control center for the **AI Automation Ecosystem (AAE)**. This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring, management, and AI-powered insights across all your platforms, workflows, and knowledge sources.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The AAE Dashboard is designed to be the central nervous system of your AI Automation Ecosystem, providing:

- **Unified Knowledge View** - Search and access content from Notion, Google Drive, GitHub, and the Railway-hosted Knowledge Lake API
- **Platform Integration Status** - Real-time monitoring of all connected platforms (Notion, Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, Railway, Docker, Zapier, MCPs)
- **LLM Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive dashboards showing performance metrics, token usage, costs, and response times
- **Workflow Automation Hub** - Centralized view of n8n workflows, Zapier automations, and MCP-driven processes
- **AI Assistant** - Context-aware chat interface for interrogating dashboard data and receiving insights

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express 4 + tRPC 11 (type-safe API)
- **Database**: MySQL/TiDB via Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Manus OAuth with role-based access control
- **Deployment**: Manus Platform (auto-scaling + global CDN)

### Hybrid n8n/MCP Integration

The dashboard is designed to work seamlessly with the AAE's hybrid architecture:

- **n8n Workflows** - For complex, multi-step workflows and scheduled tasks
- **MCPs (Model Context Protocol)** - For direct, conversational automation and real-time interactions
- **Zapier** - For third-party service integrations and simple automations

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **users** - Authentication and user management
2. **platformIntegrations** - Connection status and metadata for all integrated platforms
3. **llmMetrics** - Daily aggregated performance metrics for LLMs
4. **workflows** - n8n, Zapier, and MCP workflow status and performance
5. **knowledgeItems** - Cached references to knowledge base content from all sources
6. **notifications** - Internal notification system for dashboard alerts

### Knowledge Graph Tables (New - 2025-11-17)

7. **entities** - Core knowledge graph nodes with semantic state pipeline
   - 6 entity types: Consulting, ExecutiveAI, Agents, Content, Technology, ClientIntelligence
   - 4 semantic states: RAW → DRAFT → COOKED → CANONICAL
   - Tracks source, properties (JSON), and versioning
8. **relationships** - Edges connecting entities in the knowledge graph
   - Typed relationships (mentions, depends_on, created_by, etc.)
   - Weight (1-10) for relationship strength
   - Semantic states for relationship maturity
9. **semantic_history** - Audit trail for semantic state transitions
   - Who changed it (userId)
   - Why (reason text)
   - Complete state transition history
