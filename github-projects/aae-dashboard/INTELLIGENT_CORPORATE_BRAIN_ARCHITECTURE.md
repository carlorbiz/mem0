## 📈 Implementation Progress

### Day 1 Complete ✅ (November 17, 2025)

**Milestone 1: Knowledge Graph Foundation - Database Layer**

Successfully implemented the foundational database infrastructure for the Intelligent Corporate Brain:

#### Accomplishments

1. **Database Schema Design** ([drizzle/schema.ts](github-projects/aae-dashboard/drizzle/schema.ts#L123-L190))
   - Created 3 new tables: `entities`, `relationships`, `semantic_history`
   - Implemented semantic state pipeline: RAW → DRAFT → COOKED → CANONICAL
   - Added 6 entity types: Consulting, ExecutiveAI, Agents, Content, Technology, ClientIntelligence
   - Defined JSON properties field for flexible metadata storage
   - Built complete audit trail with timestamps and user tracking

2. **Relational Data Model** ([drizzle/relations.ts](github-projects/aae-dashboard/drizzle/relations.ts))
   - Defined bidirectional entity relationships (outgoing/incoming)
   - Connected users to entities and semantic history
   - Established relationship traversal patterns for graph queries
   - Enabled foreign key integrity via Drizzle ORM relations

3. **tRPC Knowledge Graph API** ([server/routers/knowledge.ts](github-projects/aae-dashboard/server/routers/knowledge.ts))
   - **8 production-ready endpoints**:
     - `createEntity` - Add new knowledge entities with semantic state
     - `getEntity` - Retrieve entity with all relationships (incoming/outgoing)
     - `listEntities` - Paginated listing with filters (type, state, search)
     - `createRelationship` - Connect entities with weighted relationships
     - `getRelatedEntities` - Traverse graph up to 3 hops deep
     - `promoteSemanticState` - Progress entities through pipeline (admin-only CANONICAL)
     - `getSemanticHistory` - Full audit trail of state transitions
     - `searchEntities` - Full-text search across name and description
   - Type-safe Zod validation for all inputs
   - Admin-only CANONICAL promotion enforced
   - User context integration via tRPC protected procedures

4. **Database Migration** ([drizzle/0002_sqlite_knowledge_graph.sql](github-projects/aae-dashboard/drizzle/0002_sqlite_knowledge_graph.sql))
   - **PostgreSQL schema** (Railway database - shared with Knowledge Lake API)
   - Applied successfully via Drizzle migrations
   - Indexes created for performance optimization
   - Native PostgreSQL data types and constraints

#### Technical Decisions

- **PostgreSQL on Railway**: Shared production database with Knowledge Lake API for unified data access across all services
- **Migration from D1**: Changed from Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) to PostgreSQL (December 2025) for production deployment to Hostinger
- **Zod v4 patterns**: Used `z.record(z.string(), z.any())` for proper type safety on JSON properties
- **Semantic pipeline**: Enforced forward-only state progression with audit logging

#### Current Status

✅ Database foundation complete and tested
✅ All 8 tRPC endpoints operational
✅ Ready for knowledge ingestion implementation

### Day 2 In Progress 🔄 (November 17, 2025)

**Milestone 2: Knowledge Ingestion System**

Currently working on building the ingestion pipeline to populate the knowledge graph from conversation transcripts.

**Approach**: Following rigorous "plan 3x, test 2x, revise 1x" methodology

**Tasks**:
1. Planning ingestion architecture (3 iterations)
   - Parser design for conversation transcripts
   - Entity extraction patterns (agents, topics, decisions, actions)
   - Relationship inference logic
   - tRPC ingestion endpoint design

2. Building ingestion modules
   - Transcript parser module
   - Entity extraction logic
   - Relationship creation logic
   - tRPC ingestion endpoint

3. Testing with real data
   - Test 1: Ingest sample conversation from agent-conversations/
   - Test 2: Verify entities and relationships in PostgreSQL database (Railway)
   - Revision: Fix issues discovered during testing

**Next**: Begin PLAN - ITERATION 1 for knowledge ingestion architecture

## 🎯 Strategic Vision vs Simple Implementation

### ❌ What We're NOT Building

A simple REST API that:
- Exposes basic CRUD endpoints
- Passes raw prompts directly to LLMs
- Stores data in traditional databases
- Treats each query independently
- Uses generic LLM responses

**This approach would**:
- Waste 80%+ of token budget on irrelevant context
- Produce generic, often inaccurate responses
- Require constant manual updates
- Fail to leverage relationships in corporate data
- Result in hallucinations and fact-checking overhead

### ✅ What We ARE Building

An **Intelligent Corporate Brain** that:
- Understands semantic relationships between concepts
- Retrieves precisely relevant context through hybrid search
- Routes queries to optimal LLMs based on complexity
- Maintains conversation memory across agents
- Updates knowledge in real-time from corporate systems
- Performs causal reasoning over interconnected data

**This approach**:
- Reduces token costs by 80-95% through precise context
- Provides domain-expert quality responses
- Stays current automatically through event-driven updates
- Leverages corporate knowledge graph for insights
- Eliminates hallucinations through grounded responses

**Implementation**:
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic search within graph nodes
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j or ArangoDB for relationship traversal
- **Metadata Tags**: Date, author, department, security level for filtering
- **Chunking Strategy**: Semantic units (paragraphs, sections) not arbitrary sizes

**Example Query Flow** (AI Adoption Consulting Context):
```
User (Carla): "Create a strategic AI adoption plan for a mid-size healthcare organization
struggling with practical implementation - they're stuck in pilot purgatory"

Traditional Approach (Simple API):
- Search for "AI adoption healthcare" → Get 200+ generic documents
- Send all docs to LLM (12,000+ tokens)
- LLM generates generic roadmap from public best practices
- No evidence from Carla's actual client work
- No understanding of "pilot purgatory" pattern
- No connection to proven frameworks
- No agent orchestration for research + strategy + resource creation

Knowledge Graph Approach (Intelligent Corporate Brain):
- Identify entities:
  * [Strategic_Plan, Healthcare_Organisation_Client, AI_Adoption_Challenge, Consulting_Project]
- Traverse relationships:
  * AI_Adoption_Challenge --pattern--> "Pilot Purgatory" --observed_in--> [3 previous clients]
  * Previous_Clients --solved_via--> AI_Adoption_Framework --maturity_level--> "Experimentation→Adoption"
  * Healthcare_Organisation --has_ai_maturity--> "Experimentation" --pain_point--> "Implementation Gap"
  * Strategic_Plan --uses--> Research_Foundation --cites--> [McKinsey AI Report 2024, Client Case Studies]
  * Consulting_Project --delivered--> Resource_Package [Implementation Playbook, Change Management Toolkit]
  * Resource_Package --created_by--> [Fred, Penny, Claude] --proven_success--> 85% adoption rate
  * Organisation_Type: Healthcare --requires--> [Regulatory Compliance, Clinician Buy-in, Workflow Integration]
  * User_Analytics --identifies_trend--> "Quality vs Speed" as top concern for healthcare execs

- Retrieve connected facts (950 tokens):
  * "Pattern: Pilot Purgatory = Multiple successful pilots, no production deployment"
  * "Root causes (from 3 client case studies): Governance gaps, Integration complexity, Clinician resistance"
  * "Proven solution framework: 4-phase approach with clinician co-design"
  * "Success metrics: 85% adoption, 60% efficiency gain, 40% quality improvement (client: RWAV)"
  * "Evidence sources: McKinsey 2024 AI Healthcare Report, 3 proprietary case studies, Clinician survey data"
  * "Required deliverables: Strategic Plan + Implementation Roadmap + Change Management Kit + Executive Coaching"
  * "Agent workflow: Fred (research synthesis) → Penny (competitive analysis) → Claude (framework design)"
  * "Carla's perspective (from Conversation memory): 'Quality-enhancing adoption, not just automation'"

- Multi-agent orchestration triggered:
  1. Fred: Research Foundation (synthesizes McKinsey report + case studies + clinician feedback)
  2. Penny: Competitive landscape analysis (how competitors are solving this problem)
  3. Claude: Strategic plan draft (using proven 4-phase framework, customized to this client)
  4. Fred: Resource package outline (Implementation Playbook + Change Management Toolkit)
  5. Claude Code: Generate executive presentation deck (DocsAutomator → Google Doc)
  6. Fred: Synthesis into CANONICAL state (incorporates Carla's quality-first philosophy)

- Output delivered to Carla for review:
  * Strategic Plan grounded in client case studies (not generic best practices)
  * Addresses specific "pilot purgatory" pattern with proven solution
  * Includes evidence from peer-reviewed research + proprietary client data
  * Resource package ready for customization
  * Reflects Carla's "quality-enhancing AI adoption" positioning
  * All content in COOKED state, ready for Carla to promote to CANONICAL
```

**Token Efficiency**: 950 tokens vs 12,000 tokens = **92% cost reduction**
**Quality Improvement**:
- Evidence-based (client case studies + peer-reviewed research)
- Pattern-matched (identifies and addresses "pilot purgatory" specifically)
- Proven framework (85% success rate from previous engagements)
- Brand-aligned (reflects Carla's quality-first philosophy)
- Personalized (healthcare-specific, mid-size org, implementation focus)

**Business Impact**:
- Consulting deliverable created in 1 hour vs 8 hours
- Leverages intellectual property from previous engagements
- Maintains quality through evidence-based approach
- Automatically identifies monetization opportunity (Implementation Playbook as standalone product)
- Triggers user analytics: "AI adoption implementation" trending topic → potential book chapter

### 2. Intelligent Retrieval Layer

**Purpose**: Hybrid retrieval combining vector search, graph traversal, and Mem0 memory

**Components**:

#### A. Semantic Vector Search
- Convert query to embedding using Cloudflare Workers AI
- Search Vectorize index for semantically similar chunks
- Returns top-k relevant document snippets

#### B. Graph Traversal
- Identify entities mentioned in query
- Traverse relationships (1-2 hops)
- Extract connected facts, causes, effects

#### C. Mem0 Memory Integration
- Access conversation history for context
- Retrieve user-specific preferences
- Access project-specific knowledge
- Check cross-agent shared memories

#### D. Context Assembly
```typescript
interface RetrievalResult {
  vectorResults: ChunkWithScore[];      // Semantic matches
  graphResults: EntityRelationship[];   // Connected facts
  memoryContext: ConversationMemory[];  // User/project history
  metadata: {
    retrievalTime: number;
    confidenceScores: number[];
    sources: string[];
  }
}
```

**Orchestration via Cloudflare Workers**:
```typescript
// VibeSDK Worker processes query
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const { query, userId, projectId } = await request.json();

    // 1. Parallel retrieval
    const [vectorResults, graphResults, memoryResults] = await Promise.all([
      env.VECTORIZE.query(await embedQuery(query)),
      queryKnowledgeGraph(query, env.GRAPH_DB),
      mem0Client.search({ query, userId, projectId })
    ]);

    // 2. Assemble context
    const context = assembleContext({
      vector: vectorResults,
      graph: graphResults,
      memory: memoryResults
    });

    // 3. Route to appropriate LLM
    const llm = selectLLM(analyzeComplexity(query, context));

    // 4. Generate response
    const response = await llm.generate({
      role: determineRole(query),
      task: extractTask(query),
      context: context, // Hyper-focused, relevant facts only
      format: determineFormat(query)
    });

    // 5. Update knowledge graph
    await updateGraph(response, query, userId);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Intelligent LLM Router

**Purpose**: Select optimal LLM based on query complexity and cost efficiency

**Complexity Analysis**:
```typescript
interface QueryComplexity {
  type: 'factual' | 'analytical' | 'creative' | 'conversational';
  requiredReasoning: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
  domainExpertise: 'general' | 'specialized';
  responseLength: 'short' | 'medium' | 'long';
  contextSize: number; // tokens
}

function analyzeComplexity(query: string, context: RetrievalResult): QueryComplexity {
  // Use small LLM or heuristics to classify query
  // Return complexity profile
}
```

**LLM Selection Strategy**:

| Query Type | Context | LLM Choice | Rationale |
|------------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Simple factual | Graph-provided | None needed | Answer from graph traversal |
| Factual Q&A | <500 tokens | GPT-3.5-turbo | Fast, cheap, sufficient |
| Analytical | 500-1500 tokens | Claude Sonnet | Best balance of quality/cost |
| Complex reasoning | 1500+ tokens | GPT-4 or Claude Opus | Deep analysis required |
| Code generation | Any | Specialized model | Domain-optimized (Codex, etc.) |
| Creative writing | Medium | GPT-4 or Claude | Quality prioritized |

**Cost Optimization**:
```typescript
interface CostEstimate {
  llm: string;
  inputTokens: number;
  estimatedOutputTokens: number;
  costUSD: number;
  latencyMs: number;
  qualityScore: number; // 0-1
}

function selectLLM(complexity: QueryComplexity): LLMProvider {
  const candidates = getLLMCandidates(complexity.type);
  const estimates = candidates.map(llm => estimateCost(llm, complexity));

  // Select best value = quality / (cost * latency)
  return estimates.reduce((best, current) => {
    const currentValue = current.qualityScore / (current.costUSD * current.latencyMs);
    const bestValue = best.qualityScore / (best.costUSD * best.latencyMs);
    return currentValue > bestValue ? current : best;
  }).llm;
}
```

### 4. Real-Time Knowledge Updates

**Purpose**: Keep knowledge graph current with up-to-the-minute corporate data

**Data Ingestion Pipeline**:

```

```

**Event-Driven Update Flow**:
```typescript
// Cloudflare Worker listening for corporate events
export default {
  async scheduled(event: ScheduledEvent, env: Env): Promise<void> {
    // Scheduled updates (e.g., nightly full sync)
    await syncAllSources(env);
  },

  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    // Real-time webhook updates
    const { source, eventType, data } = await request.json();

    switch (eventType) {
      case 'document.created':
        await processDocument(data, env);
        break;
      case 'customer.updated':
        await updateCustomerNode(data, env);
        break;
      case 'project.status_changed':
        await updateProjectGraph(data, env);
        break;
    }

    return new Response('OK');
  }
}

async function processDocument(doc: Document, env: Env) {
  // 1. Extract text and metadata
  const content = await extractContent(doc);

  // 2. Chunk semantically
  const chunks = await semanticChunk(content);

  // 3. Generate embeddings
  const embeddings = await Promise.all(
    chunks.map(chunk => env.AI.run('@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5', {
      text: chunk.text
    }))
  );

  // 4. Identify entities
  const entities = await extractEntities(content, env.AI);

  // 5. Update knowledge graph
  await env.GRAPH_DB.query(`
    MERGE (d:Document {id: $docId})
    SET d.title = $title,
        d.content = $content,
        d.updated = datetime()

    // Create entity relationships
    ${entities.map(e => `
      MERGE (e:${e.type} {id: $${e.id}})
      MERGE (d)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)
    `).join('\n')}
  `, { docId: doc.id, title: doc.title, content, ...entities });

  // 6. Store embeddings in Vectorize
  await env.VECTORIZE.upsert(
    chunks.map((chunk, i) => ({
      id: `${doc.id}_chunk_${i}`,
      values: embeddings[i].data[0],
      metadata: {
        docId: doc.id,
        chunkIndex: i,
        text: chunk.text
      }
    }))
  );
}
```

    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: `Course context for: ${concept}, Audience: ${audience}`,
      includeGraph: true,
      includeMemory: true
    })
  }).then(r => r.json());

  // 2. VibeSDK retrieves from Knowledge Graph
  // Returns: Related courses, market trends, audience data

  // 3. Dashboard triggers Knowledge Lake AI Brain
  const architecture = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/course/architect', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      course_concept: concept,
      audience_type: audience,
      research_foundation: context.graphResults,
      market_analysis: context.vectorResults
    })
  }).then(r => r.json());

  // 4. Dashboard distributes tasks via n8n
  await fetch('http://localhost:5678/webhook/ai-brain-course-generator', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      architecture,
      agents: {
        content: 'Fred',
        slides: 'Manus',
        audio: 'Callum',
        review: 'Claude'
      }
    })
  });

  // 5. Agents work collaboratively using Mem0 for shared context
  // 6. Dashboard monitors progress and displays updates
  // 7. Final course package auto-published via n8n workflows
}
```
