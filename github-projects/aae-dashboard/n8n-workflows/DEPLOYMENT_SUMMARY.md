## 📊 **Deployment Verification**

### **Test 1: Health Check**

```bash
# Verify n8n webhook is active
curl https://your-n8n.railway.app/webhook/aae-chat
# Expected: 405 Method Not Allowed (correct - needs POST)
```

### **Test 2: End-to-End Flow**

```bash
# Send test message
curl -X POST https://your-n8n.railway.app/webhook/aae-chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AAE-API-Key: your_webhook_key" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 1,
    "message": "How should I structure my n8n workflows?",
    "conversationHistory": [],
    "context": {"currentPage": "Dashboard"}
  }'

# Expected Response (3-5 seconds):
{
  "success": true,
  "agent": "Claude",
  "agentReason": "Strategic planning and architecture",
  "message": "For n8n workflows...",
  "entitiesCount": 2,
  "ingested": true,
  "conversationId": 170
}
```

### **Test 3: Knowledge Lake Verification**

```bash
# Check Knowledge Lake stats
curl -s https://knowledge-lake-api-production.up.railway.app/api/stats

# Expected: totalConversations increased from 169 → 170
{
  "totalConversations": 170,
  "totalEntities": 135,
  "totalRelationships": 2
}
```

### **Test 4: Dashboard Integration**

1. Open AAE Dashboard: `https://your-dashboard.railway.app`
2. Navigate to **AI Chat** page
3. Send message: "What are the latest AI agent trends?"
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Agent name appears (e.g., "Penny")
   - ✅ Response is relevant
   - ✅ Entities extracted (visible as badges)
   - ✅ Conversation in Knowledge Lake

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Issue: Webhook returns 401 Unauthorized**

**Cause**: API key mismatch

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify both services have identical keys
railway run --service n8n env | grep AAE_WEBHOOK_API_KEY
railway run --service aae-dashboard env | grep AAE_WEBHOOK_API_KEY

# If different, regenerate and sync:
NEW_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
railway variables set AAE_WEBHOOK_API_KEY=$NEW_KEY --service n8n
railway variables set AAE_WEBHOOK_API_KEY=$NEW_KEY --service aae-dashboard
```

### **Issue: Agent always returns "Fred"**

**Cause**: Routing logic not matching query patterns

**Solution**:
1. Open workflow in n8n
2. Check "Determine Agent & Complexity" node execution logs
3. Verify `scores` object shows expected pattern matches
4. Update regex patterns if needed

### **Issue: Knowledge Lake ingestion fails**

**Cause**: Knowledge Lake API unavailable or wrong URL

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test Knowledge Lake health
curl https://knowledge-lake-api-production.up.railway.app/health

# Verify environment variable
railway run --service n8n env | grep KNOWLEDGE_LAKE_URL

# Check n8n logs for detailed error
railway logs --service n8n | grep "Knowledge Lake"
```

### **Issue: Response timeout**

**Cause**: Agent response taking >30 seconds

**Solutions**:
1. Increase webhook timeout in n8n node settings
2. Implement async callback pattern (Phase 2)
3. Use AI Agent node for automatic timeout handling

### **Issue: Dashboard not showing agent attribution**

**Cause**: Chat router code not updated

**Solution**:
1. Verify `server/routers/chat.ts` has n8n webhook call
2. Check response mapping includes `agent`, `agentType`, `agentReason`
3. Update frontend to display these fields
