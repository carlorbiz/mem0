# Vancouver Citation Style – AI-Compatible Markdown Guide

The **Vancouver style** is a numerical referencing system widely used in medicine and science. It uses in-text citation numbers (in square brackets) corresponding to a sequential reference list. This format is concise, standardized, and widely accepted in scholarly publications.

## ✅ In-Text Citation Rules

- Cite sources in the order they appear using **square brackets**:  
  Example: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`
- For multiple sources:
  - Use commas for separate entries: `[1,3,5]`
  - Use a dash for consecutive sources: `[2–4]`
- Always match the in-text number with its corresponding number in the reference list.

---

## 📘 Reference List Formatting

- References are listed **numerically** in the **order of citation** (not alphabetically).
- The author’s surname is followed by initials (no commas).
- Journal titles must be **abbreviated** according to PubMed standards.
- Only the **first six authors** are listed, followed by **et al.** if there are more.
